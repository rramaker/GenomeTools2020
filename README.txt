GenomeTools2020 v1.0.1 (04/05/2020)

This README file contains a brief description of the contents of the GenomeTools2020 package of scripts. Each subfolder contains a more detailed description of the scripts functionality and dependencies.

This folder contains the subfolders to two functions:

1. SMART_BED_MERGE - This function takes a list of bed files and merges them into the fewest number of discrete loci in a manner that splits the minimal number of bed regions possible

2. STARRSEQ_MUTAGENESIS_ALIGNMENT - This function takes a list of FASTQ files and a test element FASTA and generates MPRA count tables.

A DEPENDENCIES folder is also contained in this package that contains example files and other scripts these functions depend on.
